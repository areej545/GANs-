# GANs-
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic images from random noise, demonstrating the core concept of unsupervised deep generative modeling. GANs consist of two neural networks—the Generator and the Discriminator—that are trained simultaneously in a competitive framework.
